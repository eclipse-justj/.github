## JustJ

JustJ provides fully-functional Javaâ„¢ runtimes that can be redistributed by Eclipse Projects. The form in which these are made available is intended to make these easily consumable. As such, Java runtimes are available via [p2 repositories](https://eclipse.dev/justj/?page=download#p2-update-sites) as well as via direct [packaged downloads](https://eclipse.dev/justj/?page=download#jre-downloads). The sources of these Java runtimes are any and all versions approved by the Eclipse Foundation for such purposes.

Please visit the [JustJ site](https://eclipse.dev/justj/) for details.
